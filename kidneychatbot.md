## [Doc Bot: The Chronic Kidney Disease Chat Bot](https://github.com/aliciafels/kidneydiseasechatbot)

**Project description:** I created a simple and interactive chat bot that can answer questions about chronic kidney disease. It was built using python and jupyter notebooks. 

### 1. What skills were used?

The following list shows all of the skills I used/learned will working on this project:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- Machine Learning

- AI Chat Bots

- Parsing information from a webpage to help create the bots responses

### 2. Why did I build this?

Once I started to learn how to code using Python, I wanted to learn how to create a chat bot that can help answer questions about a certain topic. With the help from the Youtube creator, Computer Science, and their video [Build A Smart AI Chat Bot Using Python & Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KZwRBg4-P0), I was able to follow along with creating my first machine learning project and first chat bot!

### 3. What will you do now?

After learning the basics of creating a chat bot by scraping information from a website, I would like to make other chat bots for other website pages. I would also like to eventually make more complex AI chat bots that is able to take the information from an entire website and not just one page.
