# MS Thesis: Memory for a Familiar and Unfamiliar University Logo

**Project Description:** Prior research found that memory is fallible and that memory for common objects is poorly encoded (Brady et al., 2008; Nickerson & Adams, 1979). Participants studied one of the logos and recalled both the familiar and unfamiliar logos. Confidence judgments were collected at preand post-recall for both logos. Results suggest that recall changed by study condition and logo type, studying before recall, for both the familiar and the unfamiliar logo, improved recall scores. The results also suggest that confidence judgments changed depending on the logo familiarity and time. Confidence decreased from pre- to post-recall for the familiar logo in both study conditions but increased for the unfamiliar logo in both study conditions. Prior research on schema memory and metamemory may explain why there is a difference in direction for the two logos. Schema incongruent items have better contextual memory and higher confidence (Sweegers et al., 2015).

## 1. The purpose/goal:

Expand on prior research by testing the study effect on recall memory for a familiar and unfamiliar stimuli and examine the metacognitive change in confidence.

## 2. Hypotheses:

1. Replicate the findings from Marmie & Healy (2004) Experiment 1. I hypothesized that there would be a study effect observed in both conditions, where recall will be higher for the studied logo when compared to it not being studied. 
2. Replicate and expand on the findings from Blake & colleagues (2015) Experiment 2. I hypothesized that confidence judgements for both logos would decrease from pre- to post-recall. 

## 3. Method

### Participants:

I collected data from 110 undergraduate students enrolled in psychology courses at one university.

**Demographics of Study Sample**

| Age | 19.0 years (1.20) [^1] |
| Gender Identity | Women: 67.3%, Men: 31.8%, Nonbinary: 0.9% |
| Grade | First year: 40.9%, Second year: 38.2%, Third year: 14.5%, Fourth year: 6.4% |
| Semesters At Current School | 2.73 semesters (2.10) [^1] |
| Ethnic/Racial Identity | Caucasian: 55.45%, Asian: 14.55%, Hispanic: 14.55%, Black/African American: 4.55%, Multi-racial: 4.55%, Indian: 3.64%, Middle Eastern: 2.73% |
| Collegiate Athlete | Non-athletes: 93.6%, Athletes: 6.4% |

### Materials and Measures:

*1. Stimuli:* Used two different university athletic logos as the stimuli for the recall task. One logo was familiar to the participants and the other was not familiar to them.

*2. Program:* Due to COVID-19 this study had to be conducted online through Microsoft Teams and coded using Qualtrics.

*3. Recall Task:* Participants were tested on the two stimuli, with their recall drawings graded on two different rubrics made up from the individual features of the logos.

*4. Familiarity Questionaire:* Participants answered a few questions to gage their familiarity with the two logos, to make sure one was completely familiar and the other was new to them.

*5. Confidence Judgements:* Confidence was measured on a 11-point Likert scale, 0 being the least confident and 10 being the most confident in their recall ability. Participants were asked to rate their confidence for the two logos before and after recall, with four questions in total.

### Design: 

An a prior power analysis was conducting using GPower to see how many participants would be needed to achieve a power of 0.8 with a medium effect size. The power analysis predicted that at least 64 participants was needed.

### Procedure:

- Participants signed up for the study using the university's *Sona Systems*.
- The research team video called participants at the beginning of their timeslot and instructed the participants to share their desktop screen.
- Then the researcher sent the participant the Qualtrics link to the study.
- They walked through the informed consent together, where the researcher made sure the participant understood that their participation was entirely voluntary, and they could stop at any point if they would like to.
- After the informed consent, participants answered some general demographics about themselves, and then answered the Familiarity Questionaire. Afterwards, they rated their confidence for both logos.
- At this point Qualtrics randomly assigns the participant into one of two groups: *Study Pirate* or *Study Bearcat*.
    - **Study Pirate:** studied the Pirate logo for 60 seconds, and then completed a 5 minute distractor task. Next they were instructed to draw the logo they studied to the best of their ability, and after they were done they were instructed to draw the logo they did not study to the best of their ability.
    - **Study Bearcat:** studied the Bearcat logo for 60 seconds, and then completed a 5 minute distractor task. Next they were instructed to draw the logo they studied to the best of their ability, and after they were done they were instructed to draw the logo they did not study to the best of their ability.
    - In both conditions after the participant was done drawing the logo, they held up the drawing to their camera so the researcher could screenshot it and save it under their assigned ID number and which logo (ex. 1234_Pirate). The images were also cropped to remove any idetifying information like their name of face.
    - Both conditions were also counterbalanced to negate order effect (draw the unstudied logo, study one logo, and then draw the studied logo).
- After both logos were drawn, participants were asked to rate their confidence for both logos one last time.
- Lastly, participants were debriefed and thanked for their time and participation.
